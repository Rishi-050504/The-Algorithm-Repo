const description = `Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) refers to the problem of finding the shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The goal is to determine the minimum distance or cost required to reach each vertex from the source. Common algorithms used to solve SSSP include Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for graphs with non-negative weights, and Bellman-Ford Algorithm which also handles negative weights.`;
